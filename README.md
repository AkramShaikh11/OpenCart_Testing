# OpenCart_Testing
OpenCart is an online store management system. It is PHP-based, using a MySQLi or PostgreSQL database and HTML components.
I was responsible for Functional testing, identify bugs and issues. I used Exploratory testing to explore the website.
I have followed all the documents like Test Scenario. Test Cases, RTM.
